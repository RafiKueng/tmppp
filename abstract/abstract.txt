Gravitational lensing describes the effect that big masses act like lenses on any object in the background. It offers the ability to address some of the currently most pressing questions in physics, like questions about the past and future development of the universe and it's unknown constituent parts like dark matter.

Since the first discovery of a gravitational lens in 1979, about 400 have been found. Currently running surveys will increase this number by a factor of 10 in the next 5 years, next generation surveys will increase it again by ten in the next 10 years. But their detection is difficult and requires much manual work, since software robots are not very good at it. For that reason, the SpaceWarps project has been started. It asks for volunteers to help with the search, with great success so far.

This proposal argues that volunteers will be essential for the next step of scientific analysis as well: the modelling of the lenses. Software has already been developed and some trials with volunteers have been done. The project aims to build an inventory of all known and yet to be discovered lenses with associated models. This inventory offers scientists the opportunity to address many open topics. Additionally, this thesis in particular (I) will address the roles of dark matter and baryons in galaxies and it (II) will produce a catalogue of lensed quasars for follow up surveys.

The project will explicitly be presented to the volunteers as a science project, not as a game. Volunteers joining the project will be educated about science, they will be included in the scientific process and contribute as citizen scientists.
