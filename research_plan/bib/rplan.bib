  abstract = {We have measured the kinematic profile of the early-type (E/S0) lens
	galaxy in the system 0047-281 ( z = 0.485) with the Echelle Spectrograph
	and Imager (ESI) on the W. M. Keck II Telescope, as part of the Lenses
	Structure and Dynamics (LSD) Survey. The central velocity dispersion
	is σ = 229 ± 15 km s -1 , and the dispersion profile is nearly flat
	to beyond one effective radius ( R e ). No significant streaming
	motion is found. Surface photometry of the lens galaxy is measured
	from Hubble Space Telescope images. From the offset from the local
	fundamental plane (FP), we measure an evolution of the effective
	mass-to-light ratio ( M / L ) of Δ log ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/583/2/606/img1.gif]

  abstract = {We expect direct lens modeling to be the key to successful and meaningful
	automated strong galaxy-scale gravitational lens detection. We have
	implemented a lens-modeling "robot" that treats every bright red
	galaxy (BRG) in a large imaging survey as a potential gravitational
	lens system. Having optimized a simple model for "typical" galaxy-scale
	gravitational lenses, we generate four assessments of model quality
	that are then used in an automated classification. The robot infers
	from these four data the lens classification parameter H that a human
	would have assigned; the inference is performed using a probability
	distribution generated from a human-classified training set of candidates,
	including realistic simulated lenses and known false positives drawn
	from the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) Extended Groth Strip (EGS)
	survey. We compute the expected purity, completeness, and rejection
	rate, and find that these statistics can be optimized for a particular
	application by changing the prior probability distribution for H
	; this is equivalent to defining the robot's "character." Adopting
	a realistic prior based on expectations for the abundance of lenses,
	we find that a lens sample may be generated that is ~100% pure, but
	only ~20% complete. This shortfall is due primarily to the oversimplicity
	of the model of both the lens light and mass. With a more optimistic
	robot, ~90% completeness can be achieved while rejecting ~90% of
	the candidate objects. The remaining candidates must be classified
	by human inspectors. Displaying the images used and produced by the
	robot on a custom "one-click" web interface, we are able to inspect
	and classify lens candidates at a rate of a few seconds per system,
	suggesting that a future 1000 deg 2 imaging survey containing 10
	7 BRGs, and some 10 4 lenses, could be successfully, and reproducibly,
	searched in a modest amount of time. We have verified our projected
	survey statistics, albeit at low significance, using the HST EGS
	data, discovering four new lens candidates in the process.}

	1. Based on the redshift-dependent intercept of the fundamental plane

	M / L ) B / dz = -0.56 ± 0.04 (all errors are 1 σ unless noted) if

	Cluster. Refitting the local intercept helps minimize potential systematic

	ratios (defined by the lensed image separations) is closely related
