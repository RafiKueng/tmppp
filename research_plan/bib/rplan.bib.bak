  abstract = {We have measured the kinematic profile of the early-type (E/S0) lens
	galaxy in the system 0047-281 ( z = 0.485) with the Echelle Spectrograph
	and Imager (ESI) on the W. M. Keck II Telescope, as part of the Lenses
	Structure and Dynamics (LSD) Survey. The central velocity dispersion
	is σ = 229 ± 15 km s -1 , and the dispersion profile is nearly flat
	to beyond one effective radius ( R e ). No significant streaming
	motion is found. Surface photometry of the lens galaxy is measured
	from Hubble Space Telescope images. From the offset from the local
	fundamental plane (FP), we measure an evolution of the effective
	mass-to-light ratio ( M / L ) of Δ log ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/583/2/606/img1.gif]

	the observed evolution of field E/S0 galaxies. (We assume h 65 =

	tangential anisotropy of the stellar velocity ellipsoid, are excluded
	at more than 99.9% CL. The total mass distribution inside R E can

	well with the maximum allowed value from the isotropic dynamical
	models (i.e., the "maximum-bulge solution"). The fact that both lens

	described inside their Einstein radii by a constant- M * / L stellar

	inner regions. Whether this conclusion can be generalized, however,
	requires the analysis of more systems. We briefly discuss our results
	in the context of E/S0 galaxy formation and cold dark matter simulations.}

	1. Based on the redshift-dependent intercept of the fundamental plane
	in the rest-frame B band, we measure an evolution rate of d log(
	M / L ) B / dz = -0.56 ± 0.04 (all errors are 1 σ unless noted) if
	we directly compare to the local intercept measured from the Coma
	Cluster. Refitting the local intercept helps minimize potential systematic
	errors and yields an evolution rate of d log( M / L ) B / dz = -0.54
	± 0.09. An evolution analysis of properly corrected aperture mass-to-light
	ratios (defined by the lensed image separations) is closely related
	to the Faber-Jackson relation. In the rest-frame B band, we find
	an evolution rate of d log( M / L ) B / dz = -0.41 ± 0.21, a present-day
	characteristic magnitude of M *0 = -19.70 + 5 log h ± 0.29 (assuming
