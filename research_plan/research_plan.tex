\begin{abstract}

Gravitational lensing describes the effect that big masses act like lenses on any object in the background.
It offers the ability to address some of the currently most pressing questions in physics, like
questions about the past and future development of the universe and it's unknown constituent parts like dark matter.

Since the first discovery of a gravitational lens in 1979, about 400 have been found.
Currently running surveys will increase this number by a factor of 10 in the next 5 years, next gen surveys will increase it again by ten in the next 10 years.
But their detection is difficult and requires much manual work, since software robots are not very good at it.
For that reason, the SpaceWarps project has been started.
It asks for volunteers to help with the search, with great success so far.

This proposal argues that volunteers will be essential for the next level of scientific analysis as well, the modelling of the lenses.
Software has already been developed and some trials with volunteers have been done.
The project aims to build an inventory of all known and yet to be discovered lenses with associated models.
This inventory offers scientists the opportunity to address many open topics.
This thesis in particular (i) will address the roles of dark matter and baryons in galaxies and (ii) will produce a catalogue of lensed quasars for follow up surveys.

The project will explicitly be presented to the volunteers as a science project, not as a game.
Volunteers joining will be educated about science, they will be included in the scientific process and contribute as citizen scientists.

\subsection{Introduction and State of Research}
\label{sec:intro}

\subsubsection{General Relativity and Gravitational Lensing}

In the year 1915, Albert Einstein published the theory of General Relativity (GR).
This theory describes the interplay of matter (energy and impulse) and space-time: It describes how the former perturbs the latter.
For the first time, GR allowed to correctly describe the anomalous precession of Mercury.
The next experimental proof of GR was the deflection of the light of a star by the sun (Eddington, 1919).
Einstein already predicted this phenomena in 1911 up to a factor of two.
This was the starting shoot for Einsteinâ€™s second great theory and the first evidence of \emph{gravitational lensing}\footnote{Even though the accuracy of this measurement was questioned in recent years, see \cite{kennefick2009testing}}.

Gravitational lensing describes the phenomena of deflection of light around a massive object, due to the deformation in space-time caused by a mass.
Quite similar to the deflection of the path of a marble rolling on a rubber sheet that is stretched into a funnel by a mass in it's centre.
If the source of the light (``source''), the massive object (``lens'') and the observer lie approximately in a line, these distortions act different to a regular optical lens.
Depending on the configuration, a background light source is sheared, intensified or even multiple times visible, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:grav_lens}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{img/grav_lens}
	\caption{Schematics of gravitational lensing}
	\label{fig:grav_lens}
\end{figure}

This phenomena is divided into three sub categories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item
    \emph{Strong lensing} occurs if the lens is extremely massive. For example single galaxies, galaxy clusters or black holes.
    Strong lensing allows not only for displacements of sources, but also for magnification and creation of multiple images, arc like structure or even rings.
    The first observed strong lensing was the twin quasar Q0957+561 discovered 1979\cite{walsh19790957} and a popular one is the Einstein Cross Q2237+030\cite{ec1985}, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:einsteinc}.
  \item
    \emph{Weak lensing} phenomena are not directly observable.
    The lensing caused by a weak or far away gravitational field causes only a distortion of the shape of the sources (shear), that can be statistically analysed.
  \item
    \emph{Micro lensing} deals with small perturbations of the perceived light magnitude from a source, caused by a gravitational field in the order of a single lensing star.
    Micro lensing is proposed to be used to detect MACHOs\footnote{Massive Astrophysical Compact Halo Object} and extra solar planets.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Scientific Relevance of Gravitational Lenses}

The effect of gravitational lensing depends on a variety of cosmological parameters.
Gravitational lenses offer means to estimate many of those parameters.
The study of a discovered gravitational lens usually involves finding the arrangement and properties of the source and the lensing objects.
Simulating these features has to lead to a similar image as seen on the telescope.
This process is commonly referred to as \emph{modelling} a gravitational lens.
These models allow to tackle down a lot of open questions in current astrophysics.

%%%%% FREFI ---

A working model of a lens allows to estimate total masses of distant lensing galaxies or clusters.
It takes into account the whole mass of the lens.
That is the visible, regular matter and the dark matter\cite{kochanek1995there}.
Thus it offers an alternative approach\footnote{Alternative to the approach of particle physics using particle colliders.} to tackle down the mystery of dark matter.
It allows to measure the ratio of visible matter to dark matter and the radial distribution of dark matter in galaxies \cite{treukoop04}.
Additionally it allows to test other standard procedures to estimate distant masses \cite{kochanek1995there}.

Looking at sources in a gravitational lensing model provides information about potentially very early objects in the universe.
Those objects can only be observed due to the magnification effect of a lens and could lead to new information about the early evolution of the universe\cite{rusin03}.

If two or more images of the same source can be observed, there is usually a time delay between those images, since the light paths of the two images have different length.
This information can be used to narrow down fundamental cosmological parameters like the cosmological constant (``the expansion of the universe'') and the Hubble constant (``the age of the universe'').
This has been described in \cite{refsdal1964} and has recently been done by \cite{age_uni}.


Models are usually produced individually by a scientist using one of the modelling codes available\footnote{see \cite{overview_soft2013} for an overview}.
This is a time consuming manual process, involving writing script files for modelling software.
For further analyses like \cite{age_uni}, several models of several lenses need to be combined.

This possibilities of gravitational lenses lead to a high demand in finding many more lenses and model them quickly to be able to further analyses.



\subsubsection{Detecting Gravitational Lenses}

Today, about 400 secure gravitational lenses have been found and another 200 likely candidates.
Most of these lenses have been found by accident by researchers looking at astronomical images for other reasons.
Using imagery from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and current ground based telescopes lead to a detection rate of about 1 lens per 1 to 10 square degrees\footnote{1 square degree $\approx$ 0.03\% of the sky}.

The first systematic surveys for gravitational lenses (DES\footnote{\url{http://www.darkenergysurvey.org}} or PanStarrs\footnote{\url{http://pan-starrs.ifa.hawaii.edu}}) start running these days.
Due to their large survey area and given the current detection rate, they are expected to lead to thousands of new discoveries over the next five years.
In the 2020s, the next generation of surveys (ground based LSST\footnote{\url{http://www.lsst.org}}, space based Euclid\footnote{\url{http://sci.esa.int/euclid/}} and WFIRST\footnote{\url{http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/}}) are expected to ramp up the detection rate and result in ten thousands of new lenses.

Current day surveys cover thousands of square degrees, containing millions of galaxy images that have to be scanned in order to find the rare lenses.
There have been trials with computer algorithms (robots) scanning the huge amount of data and automatically identify lensing systems\cite{robots}, with mixed results.
They work well in clean lensing systems with no other light sources in the background.
In most situations however, the robots either miss many lenses (low completeness) or identify many other objects as lenses (low purity).
This makes manual inspection indispensable.

Taking these results into account, the \emph{SpaceWarps} project\footnote{\url{http://www.spacewarps.org}} has been started in May 2013, as part of the \emph{Zooniverse} citizen science project\footnote{\url{https://www.zooniverse.org/}} by some of the scientists that were involved with programming robots.
In \emph{Zooniverse}, members of the public (``volunteers'', ``citizen scientists'') are invited to help to analyse different kind of scientific data that are too difficult for robots and too excessive for specialists.
Spacewarps applies this concept to the problem of finding the rare lenses in the huge stack of images produced by the surveys.
Volunteers are asked to scan though the images and mark any possible lenses.
If a configuration has been marked by many volunteers, it gets to the list of candidates.
As of January 2014, there have been ``almost 6 million classifications of images from tens of thousands of people'' that resulted in a list of 3300 lensing candidates for further investigation\footnote{preliminarily, not officially published data, taken from \url{http://blog.spacewarps.org}}.



\subsection{Own Research}

\subsubsection{Motivation}

The big success of SpaceWarps and the expected exponential increase in detected lenses lead to one problem:
They all have to been modelled to be of any scientific use.
Unfortunately, the number of physicists will probably not increase exponentially any time soon.
On the other side, robots even fail at identifying lenses, they will not be able to produce reliable models for many years.

This leads to the fundamental idea of my work:

{\bf Involve volunteers not only in the process of finding lenses,\\but also in modelling them.}

This involves several steps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Improve existing modelling software, make it user friendly and usable from all operating systems.
  \item Distil the needed knowledge down to easily digestible units understandable by non scientists.
  \item Prove that models generated by volunteers are scientifically relevant.
  \item Find volunteers willing to spend time for the project.
\end{enumerate}

Unlike other projects (like Foldit\footnote{A project solving protein folding problems; \url{http://fold.it}}) I don't intend to make it a game and hide the scientific aspect.
The project rather offers motivated volunteers new knowledge and an opportunity to contribute to science.


\subsubsection{Work already done}

I did already start working on the idea to ask volunteers to do gravitational modelling in my MSc thesis and in a follow-up paper, that will be published soon.

For my MSc thesis\cite{mscth}, I used the existing modelling framework GLASS\cite{glass2, glass} and built a web application around it, called \emph{SpaghettiLens} (SL).
SL makes it easy for volunteers to create, compare, improve and discuss models.
It runs in an up to date web browser, offloading the task to simulate the input to a back-end application server.
For a detailed overview of SL consult my MSc thesis\footnote{\url{http://www.physik.uzh.ch/~rafik/docs/spaghettilens.pdf}}.
Even though it's still in a testing phase, it is currently running and being used by a few volunteers already
\footnote{See \url{http://mite.physik.uzh.ch} for SL; \url{http://mite.physik.uzh.ch/data/4516} for a created model.}.
About 10 volunteers beta testing SL have already generated approximately 2000 models\footnote{The database shows 12'000 entries, most of these are however intermediate results or improvements of previous generated models.} of more than 1000 more or less possible lens candidates from the SpaceWarps catalogue.

The back-end currently runs as a distributed system on an outdated server that was not used any more and a few desktop machines in my office and thus is not as responsive as it could be.

The basic idea is to present the to be modelled original survey image on the left hand side, where the user identifies features like lensed images and marks them.\footnote{More precisely, the user has to identify the lensing object, find all the images of the source object and guess their ordering with respect to arrival time.}
That is sufficient to create a model, but more parameters could be entered for professionals.
In a next step, the user let the server generate a simulation of the model, based on the users input.
The model is rendered on the server side and a synthetic image is generated (among other data).
This image is shown on the right hand side and allows visual comparison to evaluate how accurate the model is (depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:client_screen}).
The user can now improve the model by trying to make the right hand side simulated image look like the original survey image on the left side by playing around with the input.
At the end of this process, the user can submit the final version of the model.
He receives a link to a summary page\footnote{for example: \url{http://mite.physik.uzh.ch/data/4516}} to be used to refer to the model.
Other users can use this link and try to revise and improve models generated by other users.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{img/client_screen.png}
	\caption{SpaghettiLens user interface}
	\label{fig:client_screen}
\end{figure}


The idea is that users discuss and compare models among each other and with scientists.
This is currently done on the discussion page of the SpaceWarps project.
This allows the volunteers to gather more experience and knowledge.
Experienced volunteers can help out new users and will be able to get help from scientists for difficult cases.

Some volunteers have published a letter\footnote{\url{http://letters.zooniverse.org/letters/86-collaborative_gravitational_lens_modelling_using_spaghettilens_a_spacewarps_project} (free login required)} at zoouniverse, using SL to collaboratively model a discovered lens candidate.

While my MSc project was to address point (1) in the list, we did follow up with an evaluation of the volunteers performance (3).
The resulting paper is in its end stages and will be published shortly\footnote{as soon as a preprint is available, the following link will redirect to the paper:
\url{http://www.physik.uzh.ch/~rafik/docs/sl_paper.php}}.

For the paper, a small set of interested volunteers were instructed using a tutorial video and on a personal basis by video con, addressing point (2).
Afterwards we did test their ability to create models by letting them model 29 generated, simulated lenses.
This was done by comparing the parameters used to generate the lenses with the ones recovered by the generated models and with models generated by a scientist.

A few minor problems were identified, but they originate from the design of the program and affected the scientist as well as the volunteers.
Those problems will be addressed and fixed in my PhD thesis, and are listed in Section~\ref{sec:plan_short}.
It was evident, that the training materials and provided instructions were sufficient to allow no scientists to create plausible models and that volunteers perform as well as scientists, given enough time to train and improve.
This paper will be a good indicator, that (3) is possible and that it's worth following this direction further.


If we could even recruit a small percentage (around 0.1\%) of the volunteers at SpaceWarps to dive in deeper, we would have a large enough user base to reliably create multiple models of all known lenses and provide quickly models to newly detected lenses.



\subsubsection{Personal Motivation}

My personal motivation for this project originates in the fact, that this project consists of a good mix of several points.

It is a physics research topic that tries to help to answer some fundamental questions about the universe.
This was the most relevant reason why I did study physics at all and why I chose not to do a streamlined, minimalistic bachelors degree but why I invested some more time to cover more topics in natural sciences.

It also involves many aspects of informatics and programming, one of my hobbies.
It is not just about making an algorithm perform a bit faster, but to develop a full scale client server application, involving a back end simulation program, databases, networks and protocols, client side and user interface programming.

The most obvious difference to others in physics is that it involves collaboration not only other scientists, but also non scientific volunteers.
On one side, the requirement that non-experts have to understand what is going on helps keeping things simple and not overcomplicate problems.
This further allows for the public to see into physics, what is being researched on and what we spend their taxes on.
(Maybe this could even help not widening the gap between the public and most of theoretical research.)
On the other side, I can use most of the skills I acquired while working with teenagers as a high school teacher, a job that I did not only to pay for my studies, but because I love to motivate people to approach and master difficult connections.


\subsection{Planned Research and Needed Resources}

I present this request, because I would like to continue and intensify my work on SL with a PhD thesis.

The thesis will go in two parallel directions:

First, I'd like continue the work on SpaghettiLens.
That would involve working together with volunteers and scientists to fix current bugs in SL and to implement new features.
This will be a ongoing process, I expect more ideas to emerge as soon as the user base increases.
Additionally it would require to build up a bigger base of volunteers that are using SL.
The best place to find new users will be the SpaceWarps forum, where many enthusiastic volunteers of SW already discuss various lens candidates, discoveries and papers and show a lot of interest in modelling.
I'll also try to reach out to organisations, schools and so on to organise presentations and work shops where I'll introduce people to astro physics, gravitational lenses and SL.
We would also like to create a central hub for all lens modelling efforts as a sub project of SpaceWarps, hosted at \url{http://labs.spacewarps.org}.
We will collect and host all alternatives to SL.
We are already working together with MasterLens Database\footnote{\url{http://admin.masterlens.org/}} that hosts a database of all known lenses and created models.


Even though I have met a lot of enthusiasm and engagement from the volunteers and I am confident SL will get a large enough user base, I am not relying on it.
In the second, parallel running part of my PhD thesis I will use SL to model all currently known lenses myself.
I will keep up with new discoveries during the thesis period to be able to present a complete catalogue of lenses and models at the end of my thesis.
This models will be used at least (i) to study the roles of dark matter and baryons in galaxies and (ii) to identify and prioritize lensed quasars for follow-up time-delay surveys.

The second part will set up an analysis pipeline for models, that will produce scientific relevant data using my own catalogue of models.
If the user base grows as expected, I'll have many more models to back up my findings, but it won't be necessary to produce valuable scientific results.


The next sections contain a bit more detailed planning for the PhD thesis.

\subsubsection{Short term: until Sept. 2014} \label{sec:plan_short}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Bring \url{labs.spacewarps.org} modelling hub online
  \item Fix currently known bugs
  \item Implement source modelling (allows scientists to do further analysis)
  \item Increase central resolution (fixes problems identified in paper)
  \item Obtain and set up the new server hardware
  \item Release first stable version of SL
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Mid term: Summer 2015}

The first year will be spent in implementing additional modelling features to SL.
As this will be in close collaboration with requests from researchers and volunteers, additional might come up.
Currently, the two major upgrades listed below are planned. I aim at having a stable prototype of those by Summer 2015.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Allow modelling of cluster lenses (for researchers / professionals)
  \item Implement photometry modelling (for volunteers)
  \item Model all known lenses. Keep up to date with newly discovered lenses and try to have all modelled as soon as discovered.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Long term: Summer 2016}

For the second year, the prototypes developed in the first year should be deployed.
Besides the work to keep SL running, I intent to use this time to evaluate the generated models and publish first analyses and scientific results.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Deploy prototypes
  \item Analyse models and publish data
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Resources}

As mentioned in previous sections, SL currently runs on a mix of outdated hardware and office computers.
Thus it does not offer the reliability and speed required for the acceptance and success of such a project among volunteers and researchers alike.
An optional one time investment in decent server hardware is favourable, and thus I am requesting additional founds for an application server.
The physics-institute would provide housing, using the already existing server room and covering power and cooling costs.

I consider the personal contact to other scientists and volunteers alike as a key component for motivating new volunteers to join the project, keep participating volunteers motivated and create a productive atmosphere among scientists and volunteers.
Thus I'm requesting a small yearly budget to travel to conferences and meetings of scientists, to organise get-together for volunteers and to organise projects to increase publicity, for example by organising special event for high schools\footnote{I do know from my time as high school teacher that there is a great demand for such events.}. Both the publicity office and the physics department showed already interest in supporting such events.

Volunteers joining the project shall do only because of personal motivation and will never be paid.
Office space and other equipment are already provided for by the physics institute.




\subsection{Expected Scientific and Broader Impact}

First, this project is essential groundwork for expanding the inventory of lenses and models from currently 400 to a tenfold in five years and maybe 100-fold in ten years.

This inventory will offer scientists the data needed to address some of the currently most pressing questions in physics, like dark matter and the expanding of the universe.
For my thesis, it will offer the opportunity (i) to get a more detailed insight in the roles of dark matter and baryons in galaxies and (ii) to produce a catalogue of lensed quasars for follow up surveys.


%A second problem addressed with my thesis is to establish a network of software, volunteers and researchers to provide the scientific community a fast and reliable way to model large amount of gravitational lenses.
%With upcoming surveys, facilities to analyse and model lenses in large scale will be required.
%We have the opportunity to build up knowledge and infrastructure to make sure the data generated by those missions are properly analysed.

Second, this project will encourage people to participate not simply as anonymous crowd-sources, but as individual citizen scientists.
People will have the ability to have an insight in a current leading research field in physics.

%The side effect of involving the public in science may not be scientifically relevant, but it just might be relevant for science.
